Due to that intent, the Sola is equipped with commodious living spaces as well as a set of solar panels that help its power management. In recent years, the vessel has made its way into the public market, becoming a popular choice for commercial hunters who make good use of the substantial amount of cold storage the vessel offers as well as its rather formidable armory.",

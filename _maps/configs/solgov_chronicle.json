	"description": "The Chronicle-class Outrider Frigate is a upgrade package of Chronicle-class Sensory Frigates typically issued to Pionierskompanien. The vessel has had most of it's clerical equipment removed in exchange for a solid design capable of front-line engineering, independent operation, and limited orbital combat. Despite the retooling, the Chronicle Outrider maintains its telecommunication array, and some crews have been known to sell access to it.",
